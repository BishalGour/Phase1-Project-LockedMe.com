# Phase1-Project-LockedMe.com

## Background of the problem statement:

Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. hired you as a Full Stack Developer. They aim to digitize their products and chose LockedMe.com as their first project to start with. You’re asked to develop a prototype of the application. The prototype of the application will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for the budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you’re asked to present the following in the next 15 working days (3 weeks): 

* Specification document - Product’s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions

* Number and duration of sprints required 

* Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 

* Java concepts being used in the project 

* Data Structures where sorting and searching techniques are used. 

* Generic features and three operations: 

   * Retrieving the file names in an ascending order

   * Business-level operations:

      * Option to add a user specified file to the application

      * Option to delete a user specified file from the application

      * Option to search a user specified file from the application

      * Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context

      * Option to close the application

   * The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible. 
 

## The flow and features of the application:

* Plan more than two sprints to complete the application

* Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart 

* List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application

* Code to display the welcome screen. It should display:

   * Application name and the developer details 

   * The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information 

   * Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed 

* The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it

* The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:

   * Add a file to the existing directory list

      * You can ignore the case sensitivity of the file names 

   * Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list

      * You can add the case sensitivity on the file name in order to ensure that the right file is deleted from the directory list

      * Return a message if FNF (File not found)

   * Search a user specified file from the main directory

      * You can add the case sensitivity on the file name to retrieve the correct file

      * Display the result upon successful operation

      * Display the result upon unsuccessful operation

   * Option to navigate back to the main context

* There should be a third option to close the application

* Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
